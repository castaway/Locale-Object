            * Added a new module: Language.pm.
            * The database now contains a table of language-country mappings.
            * New languages() method for Country.pm.
            * New lookup_dual() method for DB.pm.
            * Altered DB.pm's lookup() method - now returns a reference to an 
              array of hashes rather than an array. This should not change 
              again. Removed redundant lookup_all() method as a result.
            * Continent.pm does now really actually give back an array.
            * Added continent names to the database for some Pacific islands 
              that should have been listed as Oceania but weren't.
            * Added currencies to the db that were missing for those same 
              islands.

            * Cleaned up the API a little - the countries() method in 
              Continent.pm and Currency.pm now gives an array back, instead 
              of a hash.

            * Fixed a bit of semi-finished and outdated documentation in DB.pm 
              that had crept past me.
            * Added a little bit more documentation to copy-for-test.PL for
              clarity.

            * Initial release.
