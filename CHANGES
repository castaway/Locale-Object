            * Cleaned up the API a little - the countries() method in 
              Continent.pm and Currency.pm now gives an array back, instead 
              of a hash.

            * Fixed a bit of semi-finished and outdated documentation in DB.pm 
              that had crept past me.
            * Added a little bit more documentation to copy-for-test.PL for
              clarity.
