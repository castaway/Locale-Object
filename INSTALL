In order to install these modules, you need Module::Build. CPANPLUS.pm has 
had support for Module::Build since January of 2003; if you are currently
using CPAN.pm, please consider upgrading to CPANPLUS. A Makefile.PL is 
included with this distribution, but it will ask if you want to install 
Module::Build, and do so with CPAN.pm if you so consent, and only then 
install the distribution.

The install process is a standard Module::Build install:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
