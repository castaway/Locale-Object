NAME 

Locale::Object - OO locale information

VERSION

0.1

DESCRIPTION

The Locale::Object group of modules attempts to provide locale-related information in an object-oriented fashion. The information is collated from several sources and provided in an accompanying L<DBD::SQLite> database.

At present, the modules are:

* Locale::Object::Country - objects representing countries
* Locale::Object::Continent - objects representing continents
* Locale::Object::Currency - objects representing currencies
* Locale::Object::DB - does lookups for the modules in the database
* Locale::Object::DB::Schemata - documents the database, including all data sources.

=back

For more information, see the documentation for those modules. Forthcoming releases will include Locale::Object::Language and Locale::Object::Timezone.

KNOWN BUGS

The database of currency information is not perfect by a long stretch. If you find mistakes or missing information, please send them to the author.

CREDITS

Original concept: Pierre Denis (PDENIS). I had much useful assistance from Pierre, Tom Insam (TOMI) - who contributed to my knowledge of DBI - and James Duncan (JDUNCAN). Most of the OO concepts involved I learnt from Damian Conway (DCONWAY)'s excellent book "Object Oriented Perl" (ISBN 1-884777-79-1).
