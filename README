NAME 

Locale::Object - OO locale information

DESCRIPTION

The Locale::Object group of modules attempts to provide locale-related 
information in an object-oriented fashion. The information is collated 
from several sources and provided in an accompanying DBD::SQLite database.

At present, the modules are:

* Locale::Object                      - make compound objects containing 
                                        country, currency & language objects
* Locale::Object::Country             - objects representing countries
* Locale::Object::Continent           - objects representing continents
* Locale::Object::Currency            - objects representing currencies
* Locale::Object::Currency::Converter - convert between currencies
* Locale::Object::DB                  - does db lookups for the modules
* Locale::Object::Language            - objects representing languages

For more information, see the documentation for those modules. The database
is documented in docs/database.pod.

CREDITS

Original concept: Pierre Denis (PDENIS). I had much useful assistance from 
Pierre, Tom Insam (TOMI) - who contributed to my knowledge of DBI - and 
James Duncan (JDUNCAN). Most of the OO concepts involved I learnt from 
Damian Conway (DCONWAY)'s excellent book "Object Oriented Perl" (ISBN 
1-884777-79-1).
